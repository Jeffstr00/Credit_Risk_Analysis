# Credit_Risk_Analysis: Supervised Machine Learning and Credit Risk

Hi!  As you can see, I have yet to do the written analysis portion of this challenge.  I have all of coding for the first three deliverables done.  However, while my results were always close to the answers provided in the output, they never quite matched up.  I wasn't sure if things are okay, and that's going to happen when running these machine learning programs (although I thought they'd be the same if we both used random_state=1), or if I screwed up something in the beginning that in turn messed everything else up.  Anyway, I figured that it was probably a good idea to check and make sure that everything looks good before I go on to do a writeup that I ultimately have to scrap when I possibly get back the grade, realize I did something wrong, and have to do it all over again.
